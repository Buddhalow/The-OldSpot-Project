# OldSpot

An OldOS spinoff for Spotify.

An open source Spotify web client that resembles what Spotify was in 2009 based on my open source HTML5-frontend 'Bungalow' frame that is very extensible. It is based on
HTML5 web components and is split in four distinct parts:

This software is for nostalgic only and is a spin off of the OldOS-project (https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project) That resembles the old days of <= iOS 6.x.

* Plugins: Plugins can hook into various parts of the app (and other apps too).
* Services: Back-end service in Node, discovered as node modules in service folder.
* Themes: Themes can be installed into the app into the  client/themes folder which then can be discovered by the app

The goal is to create a framework like CakePHP but for pure front-end work.

Work in progress
